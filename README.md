# Jessica's Progressive Web Application

## Description

I was given the task of building a text editor that runs in the browser. A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Text editors are provided with operating systems and software development packages. They can be used to change files such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. I was required to use different data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The app also needs to be able to be downloaded and function locally without internet service.

## Usage

To build this text editor I started with an existing application and implemented methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. To start the application run 'npm run start' from the root directory to start the backend and serve the client. Then run the text editor from your terminal to see the JavaScript files that have been bundled using webpack and the generated HTML file, service worker, and manifest.json file. Then open the text editor in the brower, enter content, and observe the content being saved with IndexedDB. Click the install button to download the application to use offline.
